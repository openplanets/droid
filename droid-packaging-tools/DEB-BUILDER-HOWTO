Copy all the files in the deb-builder directory into the base path of droid. 

The directory should look like the following:

- build-stamp
- CHANGELOG
- configure
- debian
- droid
   |
   - droid.sh
   - droid.bat
   - droid-command-line-X.X.jar
   - (rest of droid)
- LICENSE
- Makefile
- README

You MUST update the CHANGELOG to reflect changes, the syntax and spacing in this file is CRITICAL

To update dependancies, edit debian/control

To build run dpkg-buildpackage (which must be installed on your build machine)

More on building debian packages can be found by googling.
