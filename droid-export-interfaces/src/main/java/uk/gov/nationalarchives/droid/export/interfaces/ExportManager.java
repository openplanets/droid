     * The only reason this interface takes an optional filter
     * is so that the command line can pass in one of its own 
     * filters.  This is because various parts of the code
     * use a particular implementation of Filter (FilterImpl)
     * rather than using the Filter interface (and modifying
     * it appropriately to be generally useful).
     * The upshot is that you cannot set a generic Filter 
     * on a given profile, only a FilterImpl, so if you want
     * to use a different kind of filter (as the command line 
     * does), you have to override the use of it in each profile,
     * rather than just setting it on the profile directly.
     * 
     * @param profileIds the list of profiles to export.
     * @param destination the destination filename
     * @param filter optional filter
     * @param options the options for export.
     * @return future for cancelling the task.
