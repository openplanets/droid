/**
 * DROID core API.
 * Call submit() to submit identification requests.
 * 
 * This interface is somewhat artificial, reflecting the original split
 * between binary signature processing and later forms of identification
 * (container signatures).  Since these signatures interact, we require
 * "fix-up" methods here.
 * 
 * Specifically:
 * 
 * 1) If there is a container signature for a puid, we do not
 * want to run any defined binary signatures for the same puid, as this 
 * would be redundant.
 * 
 * 2) All file formats and their extensions are defined in the binary
 * signature file alone (so exist in implementations of this interface).
 * However, we need to be able to perform extension checking and 
 * extension mismatch checking on container signature results
 * as well as for binary signature results, so there are public methods
 * to allow this.
 * 
 * Eventually, it would be a good idea to have a single identification interface,
 * with separate interfaces / classes to perform these other individual functions
 * accessible behind the main identification interface.
